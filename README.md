Title  : 'automatanism' - a simple cellular automaton emulating arbitrary life ( yet another game of life code )

**Game rules, internet notes & background information**

	**Note** 
		The number of live neighbors is always based on the cells before the rule was applied. In other words, we must first find all of the cells that change before changing any of them. 
		Sounds like a job for a computer!

	**Background**
		Life was invented by the mathematician John Conway in 1970. He choose the rules carefully after trying many other possibilities, some of which caused the cells to die too fast and others 
		which caused too many cells to be born. Life balances these tendencies, making it hard to tell whether a pattern will die out completely, form a stable population, or grow forever.
		
		Life is just one example of a cellular automaton, which is any system in which rules are applied to cells and their neighbors in a regular grid.
		
		There has been much recent interest in cellular automata, a field of mathematical research. Life is one of the simplest cellular automata to have been studied, but many others have been 
		invented, often to simulate systems in the real world.
		
		In addition to the original rules, Life can be played on other kinds of grids with more complex patterns. There are rules for playing on hexagons arranged in a honeycomb pattern, and
		games where cells can have more than two states (imagine live cells with different colors).
		
		Life is probably the most often programmed computer game in existence. There are many different variations and information on the web. (See the Paul Callahan's home page for more information.)
	
	**Game rules**
		rule 0) A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell ( birth ).
		rule 1) A live cell with two or three live neighbors stays alive ( survival ).
		otherwise) In all other cases, a cell dies or remains dead (overcrowding or loneliness).
